</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner;
    </li>

        unless expressly permitted by MyPiece;
    </li>
    <li>
        May be disabled by MyPiece at any time for any reason without liability to MyPiece;
    </li>

    requested through the use of the Application or the Services. MyPiece only acts as intermediary between you and the Restaurants. The provision of the
    Products and fulfillment of any Orders by the Restaurants to you is subject to the agreement which must be executed between you and the Restaurants.

    Restaurants, and that MyPiece may charge your credit card account as provided by you when registering for the Services for the Products (including any

    for providing MyPiece with a valid credit card account for payment at all times. Any payment made is non-refundable.

    of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Application and Services will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy
    policies of your credit card issuer in addition to these Terms. MyPiece is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    MyPiece is also not accountable for the quality of the dining experience, food services, or any other form of interactions between the customer and dining
    establishment. In these cases, legal onus in regards to customer satisfaction and the fulfilment of the deals lies with the Restaurants.

<p>
    Under no circumstances will MyPiece and its affiliates be held liable of any issuing damages whatsoever including but not limited to nominal, punitive,
    incidental, exemplary, compensatory, special, or indirect damages arising from use or in connection to The Site and its Services, whether the prosecuting
    party has been previously informed of the possibility of such damages or not. By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree that MyPiece takes no

    through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii)MyPiece’s use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of
    the rights of any third party, including Third Party that process payment (the Payment Processor).
